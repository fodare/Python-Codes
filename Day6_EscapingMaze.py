# defining a function is creating a function like below:


# def function_name():
#     # Do something
#     print('Hello world')
#     print('This is a function call')

# # To trigger / call / execute a function we simply need to call the function like below:


# function_name()


# While loops are types of conditional statement that keeps executing as lond as a certain condition is true.

num_student = 20
# While condition is true. perform the actions below
while num_student > 0:
    print(f"Welcome student {num_student}")
    num_student -= 1
